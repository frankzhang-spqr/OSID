# Model Improvements Required

## Current Issues
1. Model A (Offensive Detection):
   - False negatives on subtle offensive content
   - Current accuracy: 73.45%
   - Target: 94%

2. Model B (Targeted Detection):
   - Good accuracy (82.05%) but poor performance on UNT class
   - Needs better balance between classes

3. Model C (Target Classification):
   - Low accuracy (59.02%)
   - Poor performance on GRP and OTH classes

## Proposed Improvements

1. Enhanced Text Preprocessing:
   - Add NLTK for better tokenization
   - Include sentiment analysis scores as features
   - Handle negations properly
   - Better handling of slang and abbreviations

2. Model Architecture:
   - Add pretrained embeddings (GloVe/FastText)
   - Increase model capacity
   - Add attention mechanisms
   - Implement ensemble learning

3. Training Strategy:
   - Data augmentation for minority classes
   - Cross-validation for better generalization
   - Progressive learning rates
   - Class-balanced loss functions

4. Additional Features:
   - Sentiment scores
   - Toxicity scores
   - Emotion detection
   - Context embeddings

Would you like me to implement these improvements to achieve higher accuracy?
